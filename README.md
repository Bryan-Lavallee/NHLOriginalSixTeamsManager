# NHLOriginalSixTeamsManager
Manage Original Six NHL teams for 2015/2016 season

Academic project that requested several key features to be implemented: bulk data loading, AJAX, Javascript and ability to upload media items.
All of these were implemented and to build off of this academic project I made it so that a user can trade players between teams. The trade
would take the selected player from say Toronto Maple Leafs and if the other team was New York Rangers, the Rangers would aquire the player.
This could also go the other way, and you can trade multiple players at once!

The running application looks like:

Feel free to download and test for yourself! User authentication is required, but if you do not want to go to the hassle, you will just have to comment
out that authorization required code at the beginning of several functions. 


Thank you for checking this out! Please feel free to give me any feedback as I am always looking to improve my skills in web application developement.

Thanks again,

Bryan Lavallee
